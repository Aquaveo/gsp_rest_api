# Global Streamflow Prediction REST API
This is a container containing a REST API that can be used to access data from the GEOGloWS ECMWF Streamflow Project. 
This draft is a stripped-down version of the Streamflow Prediction Tool (SPT) REST API that can be installed without 
Tethys Platform and the SPT app.
