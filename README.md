# Global Streamflow Prediction REST API
This is a draft of a stripped-down version of the Streamflow Prediction Tool (SPT) REST API that can be installed without the SPT.

## Details
+ This draft uses Docker and does not require the installation of Tethys platform or the SPT.
+ get_streamflow is the only request available at the moment.
+ More methods will be developed in the future.
